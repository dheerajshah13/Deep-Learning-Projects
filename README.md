# Deep-Learning-Projects

This is Implementation of Tensorflow integrated with high level Api Keras
Note:
I have created my own dataset for just basic implementation that is:
# letâ€™s suppose that an experimental drug was tested on individuals ranging from age 13 to 100 in a clinical trial. The trial had 2100 participants. Half of the participants were under 65 years old, and the other half was 65 years of age or older.The trial showed that around 95% of patients 65 or older experienced side effects from the drug, and around 95% of patients under 65 experienced no side effects, generally showing that elderly individuals were more likely to experience side effects.

Ultimately, we want to build a model to tell us whether or not a patient will experience side effects solely based on the patient's age. The judgement of the model will be based on the training data.

Note that with the simplicity of the data along with the conclusions drawn from it, a neural network may be overkill, but understand this is just to first get introduced to working with data for deep learning.
